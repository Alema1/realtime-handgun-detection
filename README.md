# About

A real time handgun detection model trained using an enhanced version of the public pistol dataset by University of Granada modified by me containing a total of 7108 images, 6.2K images for training, 594 images for evaluation and 297 for testing. The model was trained using 100 Epochs using a Nvidia Tesla K80.

In this repo, you will find all the pictures used for tranining, validation and testing of the detection model, plus the already trained model in the PyTorch format (.pt) used in the first tests of the S.P.E.A.R. prototype.
